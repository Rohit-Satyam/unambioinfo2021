***2nd Workshop in Advanced Bioinformatics*** is proceeding as a [Virtual Workshop](http://132.248.227.114/), February 8 - 12, 2021. Through this workshop, students will learn how to analyze biological networks with R, to build co-expression networks and what network medicine is . 
Courses will be taught by experts in the area and will consist of theoretical and practical modules. Moreover, students will be able to develop a project of their choice, that will be led by an International researcher and a experienced Bioinformatics TA.

## Please Note

The course will be held entirely online and in English. When needed, programming will be done in R, with R Markdown used for final presentations. However, project can be implemented in any other programming languages.

Applicants should have some basic familiarity with bioinformatics and R, as well as the capability to reliably connect online via Zoom. We encourage successful applicants who may have concerns in these regards to address them prior to the course, contacting the organizers if necessary.

Because the course will assemble experienced researchers from around the world for virtual seminars and projects, commitment on the part of applicants is essential. Applicants should expect to participate in the full 40 hours of the course.
